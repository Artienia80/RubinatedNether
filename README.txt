Rubinated Nether is a Vanilla+ mod adding Minecraft's scrapped Ruby. This mod adds several utility and decoration blocks, with a revamped Nether Progression.

Current Features
================

Acquire Rubies
Within the Nether you may find Rubies near the **Lava Ocean**, near the **Nether Roof** or in **Piglin Bastions**. Harvest them with a Diamond Pickaxe.

Freeze Rubies
Using the **Freezer**, you can freeze **Molten Rubies** into **Rubies**, Ice into its colder variants, Magma Cream into Slimeballs and Magma Blocks into Obsidian. Freezing Snow yields the (un)obtainable Frosted Ice.

Ruby Laser
Craft the **Ruby Laser** to detect entities and blocks in its path. Its beam is invisible unless you wear **Ruby Lenses** on your head. Alternatively, place Glass **directly** in front of the Ruby Laser to make its beam visible. Stained Glass tints the laser beam. Its block output is proportional to how close the block or entity is. The laser beam detects block hitboxes. Right-clicking the laser will turn it **Tinted**, making it only detect blocks and not entities. Placing **Tinted Glass** in the path of the laser will shorten it's range without redstone output. Currently only works with **Tinted** mode.

Barter with Piglins
Break Rubies into **Ruby Shards** for a more economical and efficient way to Barter with Piglins.

Fight Fire with Fire
Use **Soakstones** to soak up lava like a sponge, or craft a _Ruby Brazier_ to have Fire Resistance applied to you.

Protect Your Base
Craft **Ruby Glass** for a blast-proof window, or **Bleeding Obsidian** to invite nightmares. You can Rubinate obsidian by right clicking any Crying Obsidian with a Ruby Shard.

Decorate your Base
**Ruby Chandeliers**, **Ruby Lanterns** and **Ruby Lava Lamps** are all stylish decorations to light up your surroundings! **Blocks of Molten Ruby** and **Molten Ruby Glass** also glow! Ruby Chandeliers can be dropped onto enemies and players like Dripstone Spikes.

Vanilla armor also supports **Ruby Armor Trims** for an orange-hue trim.

Mod Compatibility
Rubinated Nether is compatible with **Spelunkery** (Rough Ruby variants), **Jaden's Nether Expansion**, **The Aether**, and other libraries. The mod also offers a variety of config features to customize the mod.
